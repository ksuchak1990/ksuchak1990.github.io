    "section": "",
    "text": "Roadside collisions are a significant problem faced by all countries. Urbanisation has led to an increase in traffic congestion and roadside vehicle collisions. According to the UK Government’s Department for Transport, most vehicle collisions occur on urban roads, with empirical evidence showing drivers are more likely to break local and fixed speed limits in urban environments. Analysis conducted by the Department for Transport found that the UK’s accident prevention measure’s cost is estimated to be £33bn per year. Therefore, there is a strong motivation to investigate the causes of roadside collisions in urban environments to better prepare traffic management, support local council policies, and ultimately reduce collision rates. This study utilises agent-based modelling as a tool to plan, experiment and investigate the relationship between speeding and vehicle density with collisions. The study found that higher traffic density results in more vehicles travelling at a slower speed, regardless of the degree to which drivers comply with speed restrictions. Secondly, collisions increase linearly as speed compliance is reduced for all densities. Collisions are lowest when all vehicles comply with speed limits for all densities. Lastly, higher global traffic densities result in higher local traffic densities near-collision sites across all adherence levels, increasing the likelihood of congestion around these sites. This work, when extended to real-world applications using empirical data, can support effective road safety policies."

    "text": "Global problems, such as pandemics and climate change, require rapid international coordination and diffusion of policy. These phenomena are rare however, with one notable example being the international policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. Here we build an agent-based model of this rapid policy diffusion, where countries constitute the agents and with the principal mechanism for diffusion being peer mimicry. Since it is challenging to predict accurately the policy diffusion curve, we utilize data assimilation, that is an “on-line” feed of data to constrain the model against observations. The specific data assimilation algorithm we apply is a particle filter because of its convenient implementation, its ability to handle categorical variables and because the model is not overly computationally expensive, hence a more efficient algorithm is not required. We find that the model alone is able to predict the policy diffusion relatively well with an ensemble of at least 100 simulation runs. The particle filter however improves the fit to the data, reliably so from 500 runs upwards, and increasing filtering frequency results in improved prediction."

We focus on simple transport-health interactions between switching between car and bus: the exposure to activity and pollution linked to these modes and how these changes effect health status, which in turn influences the mode choice.\nWe identify a basic causal loop diagram of key conceptual feedback between mode choice and health status (related to exposure to activity and pollution). From this we build a simple system dynamics stock and flow simulation model, with data input from spatial micro-simulation synthetic populations derived from ‘track and trace’ data as the output from an agent-based model. We then analyse scenarios of mode shift incentivised by bus fare reduction and bus frequency increase.\nIn the tested scenarios of this novel modelling approach, we identify that a reduction in bus fare or increase in bus frequency could incentivise a shift from car to bus which would result in a small decrease in relative risk of all causes mortality. Reducing bus fare in particular could provide both health and financial benefits for the most deprived communities.\nThis modelling approach presented in this data is a promising new method for the study of complex transport-health interactions.

Results for temporal pattern features in the response variable were captured with reasonable accuracy. Variation in the temporal pattern features for the exposure variable was underestimated by the models. The models showed some lack of precision.

    "section": "",
    "text": "By 2020, over 100 countries had expanded electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (EV/PHEV) technologies, with global sales surpassing 7 million units. Governments are adopting cleaner vehicle technologies due to the proven environmental and health implications of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), as evidenced by the recent COP26 meeting. This article proposes an agent-based model of vehicle activity as a tool for quantifying energy consumption by simulating a fleet of EV/PHEVs within an urban street network at various spatio-temporal resolutions. Driver behaviour plays a significant role in energy consumption; thus, simulating various levels of individual behaviour and enhancing heterogeneity should provide more accurate results of potential energy demand in cities. The study found that (1) energy consumption is lowest when speed limit adherence increases (low variance in behaviour) and is highest when acceleration/deceleration patterns vary (high variance in behaviour); (2) vehicles that travel for shorter distances while abiding by speed limit rules are more energy efficient compared to those that speed and travel for longer; and (3) on average, for tested vehicles, EV/PHEVs were £233.13 cheaper to run than ICEVs across all experiment conditions. The difference in the average fuel costs (electricity and petrol) shrinks at the vehicle level as driver behaviour is less varied (more homogeneous). This research should allow policymakers to quantify the demand for energy and subsequent fuel costs in cities."

    "title": "Coupling an agent-based model and an ensemble Kalman filter for real-time crowd modelling",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Agent-based modelling has emerged as a powerful tool for modelling systems that are driven by discrete, heterogeneous individuals and has proven particularly popular in the realm of pedestrian simulation. However, real-time agent-based simulations face the challenge that they will diverge from the real system over time. This paper addresses this challenge by integrating the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with an agent-based crowd model to enhance its accuracy in real time. Using the example of Grand Central Station in New York, we demonstrate how our approach can update the state of an agent-based model in real time, aligning it with the evolution of the actual system. The findings reveal that the EnKF can substantially improve the accuracy of agent-based pedestrian simulations by assimilating data as they evolve. This approach not only offers efficiency advantages over existing methods but also presents a more realistic representation of a complex environment than most previous attempts. The potential applications of this method span the management of public spaces under ‘normality’ to exceptional circumstances such as disaster response, marking a significant advancement for real-time agent-based modelling applications."

    "text": "Agent-based modelling has emerged as a powerful tool for modelling systems that are driven by discrete, heterogeneous individuals and has proven particularly popular in the realm of pedestrian simulation. However, real-time agent-based simulations face the challenge that they will diverge from the real system over time. This paper addresses this challenge by integrating the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with an agent-based crowd model to enhance its accuracy in real time. Using the example of Grand Central Station in New York, we demonstrate how our approach can update the state of an agent-based model in real time, aligning it with the evolution of the actual system. The findings reveal that the EnKF can substantially improve the accuracy of agent-based pedestrian simulations by assimilating data as they evolve. This approach not only offers efficiency advantages over existing methods but also presents a more realistic representation of a complex environment than most previous attempts. The potential applications of this method span the management of public spaces under ‘normality’ to exceptional circumstances such as disaster response, marking a significant advancement for real-time agent-based modelling applications."
