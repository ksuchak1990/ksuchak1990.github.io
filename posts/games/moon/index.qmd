## Theming

## Setting up

1. Put all Hearts, Rovers and Resources on the table within reach of all
   players, forming the **General Supply**.
2. Place the Flag Reward Board near the centre of the table.
    a) Place a 3-Heart token on the space under each Flag.
    b) Place 3 Hearts on the X space.
    c) Stack the five 4-Heart tokens and five 5-Heart tokens next to the board.
3. In the centre of the table, place $n$ random Reputation Cards of each level
   face-up, where $n$ is the number of players.
4. Place the Structure Cards for each of the Eras in separate decks on the
   table.
5. Place one of the Era 1 cards next to the Flag Reward Board - this is the
   Discard Pile.
6. Provide each player with the following:
    * A Base Card,
    * A Player Aid Card, and
    * Two Rovers.
7. Give the First Expedition Card to the player with the loudest voice; use the
   appropriate card for the number of players.
8. Place each of the Expedition Decks on the table.

### Two-player games

## Rounds

* The game is played in three rounds called Eras
* Each Era consists of the following phases:
    1. Production Phase: Players produce Resources, Rovers and Hearts from their
       Settlements.
    2. Construction Phase: Players pick a card from their hands to Build or
       Assimilate, then pass their hand to the next player.
    3. Scoring Phase: Players claim the Hearts on the Flag Reward Board and
       score any Hearts placed on their Structure and Reputation Cards.

### Production phase

* In this phase, all players claim the Resources and other items depicted on the
  Production Symbols in their Settlement.
* In the first Production Phase, players only have the Production Symbols on
  their Base Card.
* Production Symbols on Structure Cards also produce immediately when built in
  the Construction Phase.

### Construction phase

* In this phase, players take turn acquiring cards and placing them in their
  Settlements.
* Start the phase by taking the following actions:
    1. If at the beginning of either Era 2 or Era 3:
        a) Form a new Discard Pile with a card from the appropriate Era Structure 
           Card Deck.
        b) Deal each player a hand from the current Era Structure Card Deck
        (according to @tbl-handsize).
    2. Deal a random Expedition Card to each player (except the player with the
       First Expedition Card) using the appropriate Era Expedition Deck.
* Each player now has a hand consisting of multiple Structure Cards and one
  Expedition Card.
* Players take turns (starting with the player holding the First Expedition
  Card), proceeding in clockwise order.
* Turns take the following form:
    * A player must either:
        a) Build, or
        b) Assimilate.
    * A player may do any of the following actions once at any point in their
      turn:
        a) Use the Bonus Action on their Expedition Card,
        b) Park a Rover,
        c) Claim a Reputation Card,
        d) Flip over a pink Action Card.
* After all players have taken a turn, they pass their hand (including
  Expedition Card) to the player to the left.
* Repeat the turn process until only the Expedition Cards are left in players'
  hands.
