I am a Research Fellow in Mobility Data Science in the School of Geography at
the University of Leeds.
Within the school, I am a member of the Institute for Spatial Data Science and
the Mobility Science Lab.
My current research focuses on exploring the mobility of healthcare workers and
its impact on the way in which infections spread within healthcare settings;
this research forms part of a broader digital health hub focused on
antimicrobial resistance.
I previously did my PhD at the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics, working on
the development of novel methods for the real-time simulation of pedestrian
systems.
During my PhD, I also held the role of Data Science Fellow with the Connected
Places Catapult, working on modelling and mapping the incidence of social
isolation.
