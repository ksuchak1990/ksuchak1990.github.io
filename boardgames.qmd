This page lists the boardgames in my collection.
My aim is to create 1-page summary of the setup and rules for each of these
games which can be easily accessed by the people with whom I play these games.

All cover images and descriptions are sourced from 
[BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/).
